Currently under development -- persistent-sheeple allows you to create sheeple objects that are
automatically persisted to a couchdb database.

Example of work so far:

PSHEEP> (load-db "test")
#<DATABASE #x153227BE>
PSHEEP> (pclone () ((var "value")))
#<Persistent Sheep ID: 1 #x15330386>
PSHEEP> (find-sheep-with-id 1)
#<Persistent Sheep ID: 1 #x15330386>

Since it's backed by couchdb, there is no shutdown procedure -- the database is either loaded,
or it's not -- and psheep objects are reloaded in their last state when load-db is called.
